Start with art? Where to go after though...?

Use figma for designing the different lesson SVGs.

Maybe starting with original image from our class? Maybe a globe?

Could be cool to try to think of things as "lessons" so that it can connect back to a classroom but also the idea of lessons starting at 0 to incorporate a computer science theme.

Switch things from vertical to horizontal scroll to provide variation and also because most websites don't do this -> idea of going agains the normal website?

!! Javascript animation for the vertical scroll not working, fix later

Look back at how links could play into the project? --> maybe a throughline of things being linked and the user has to link to them? (Could add complexity as well?)

Ending as a way of showing completion? Also trying to convey the cyclical nature of this. Maybe go back to the first page to show that you can keep learning and improving?
